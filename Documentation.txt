1. Lambda-1 setup.
Apart from the "aws", the function also needs a "twilio" package, so both the function .js file and the node_modules directory has to be zipped and uploaded as code for Lambda-1.
In configuration > Handler should be the name of the zipped function with .handler extension.
Function validates the authenticity of the request (that the request came directly from Twilio and no data was corrupted) and puts the data record to the Kinesis stream.

2. API Gateway setup.
In API Gateway create some API. (e.g. LambdaMicroservice)
In Lambda settings find Triggers > Add trigger, choose API Gateway and point the created API to Lambda function.
In the created API, that is pointing to the function, create a POST method.
Don't forget to Actions > Deploy API to deploy the changes or the endpoint won't be visible from the Internet.

3. Kinesis Stream setup.
Create Kinesis Stream, specify the name of the stream.

4. Lambda-2A and Lambda-2B setup.
Triggers > Add trigger, choose the created Kinesis Stream.
Functions will poll that stream every second and run itself if there are any records present.

5. Kinesis Firehose.
